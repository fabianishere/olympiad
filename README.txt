This directory contains the solutions to the problems of the Dutch Olympiad of Informatics.

To use solution 1, simply run "olympiad/num2word.py" with Python and enter the number you want to convert through the standard input which will output the correct Dutch word to the standard output. 

You can use solution 1a by running "olympiad/tdrop.py" with Python without arguments. The program will read the direction and the position from a in.txt and write the results to out.txt.

Solution 1b use be tested by running "olympiad/tdrop.py" with Python with "b" as argument. ("$ python3 olympiad/tdrop.py b") You can then input a number through the standard input and the program will write the result to the standard output.

The solutions are written in Python and are tested on Arch Linux with Python 3.3.2 and Mac OS X Mavericks 10.9 with Python 3.3.2, so we highly recommend running it with Python 3.
